BRIX
======
BRIX is a simple brick game, designed using pure HTML5 and JS.

### Background ###
------------------
With the entry of HTML5 into the web scene and everyone around calling it a Flash-Killer, I wanted to try out
the classy new &lt;canvas&gt; tag.
BRIX is a leisure time project developed in 2011 summer.

### Acknowledgement ###
